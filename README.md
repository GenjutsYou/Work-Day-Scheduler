## Installation

No installation required, simply open the web page in a browser.

## Usage

To use the Work-Day Scheduler, open the web page and you will see the current day displayed at the top of the calendar. Scroll down to view time blocks for standard business hours from 9am to 5pm. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Click into a time block to enter an event, and click the save button for that time block to save the event text in local storage. The saved events will persist even if you refresh the page.
